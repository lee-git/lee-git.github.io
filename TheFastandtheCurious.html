<p>The Fast and the Curious is a fast-paced collection of 24 mini-games.  Teams rush from station to station, collecting points by quickly mastering unexpected challenges.  Everyone on the team gets a chance to shine as they are tested on things like creativity, cooperation, and high-energy fun.</p>

<p>The Fast and the Curious runs about 45 minutes, so it is perfect for a game night or all-nighter.  It is designed to work with minimal supplies for the budget-conscious.  It can run with just a few players and one leader, all the way up to about 50 players and six leaders.</p>

<p>Included are game directions, a materials list, a cover image, printable instructions for each game station, printable signs to identify stations, and a scoring sheet.</p>
